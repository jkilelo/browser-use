## Overview

Browser Use has native integrations with [Lucidic AI](https://lucidic.ai) and [Laminar](https://lmnr.ai) - powerful platforms for tracing, monitoring, and analyzing AI agent executions. These integrations provide comprehensive visibility into browser automation workflows, agent decision-making, and performance metrics.

## Lucidic AI

<Note>
    Lucidic AI is the all-in-one agent dev platform with tracing, state management, and customizable evaluations.
</Note>

### Setup

To setup Lucidic AI, you need to install the `lucidicai` package and obtain your API key and agent ID from the [Lucidic AI platform](https://lucidic.ai).

```bash
pip install lucidicai
export LUCIDIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LUCIDIC_AGENT_ID=<your-agent-id>
```

You can leave these in your .env file, or pass them in during initialization.

### Usage

Initialize Lucidic AI at the start of your project and it will automatically trace all Browser Use agent steps, including goals, actions, state, and screenshots.

```python {5-6, 8-9}
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio

import lucidicai as lai

# Initialize Lucidic AI session
lai.init()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="open google, search for AI observability tools",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Viewing Traces

The Trace View shows a comprehensive timeline of your agent run. It includes all steps and events in sequential order.

It shows:
 - Basic Information: **Status, Model, Start Time, Duration, Cost**
 - **Prettified vs Raw Request/Response** (click the wand/text icon in the top right of Input/Output to toggle)
 - **Screenshots** and multimodal data

> **Pro tip:** **SPEED UP** iteration and debugging time by avoiding rerunning the same failed run with [Time Travels](https://docs.lucidic.ai/features/time-travel). They enable you to freeze time and rerun the event in isolation to see if your error/success is reliable.

## Laminar

<Note>
  Laminar excels at tracing browser agents by providing unified visibility into
  both browser session recordings and agent execution steps.
</Note>

### Setup

To setup Laminar, you need to install the `lmnr` package and set the `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` environment variable.

To get your project API key, you can either:

- Register on [Laminar Cloud](https://lmnr.ai) and get the key from your project settings
- Or spin up a local Laminar instance and get the key from the settings page

```bash
pip install 'lmnr[all]'
export LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=<your-project-api-key>
```

### Usage

Then, you simply initialize the Laminar at the top of your project and both Browser Use and session recordings will be automatically traced.

```python {5-8}
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio

from lmnr import Laminar, Instruments
# this line auto-instruments Browser Use and any browser you use (local or remote)
Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="...", disable_batch=True, disabled_instruments={Instruments.BROWSER_USE}) # you can also pass project api key here

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="open google, search Laminar AI",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Viewing Traces

You can view traces in the Laminar UI by going to the traces tab in your project.
When you select a trace, you can see both the browser session recording and the agent execution steps.

Timeline of the browser session is synced with the agent execution steps, timeline highlights indicate the agent's current step synced with the browser session.
In the trace view, you can also see the agent's current step, the tool it's using, and the tool's input and output. Tools are highlighted in the timeline with a yellow color.
